# Java DSA Repository

Welcome to the **Java DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! This project contains a structured collection of essential DSA implementations in Java, designed to help students, developers, and interview candidates strengthen their programming foundations.

## ðŸ“˜ Contents

This repository covers:

- âœ… Core Data Structures (Array, Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Tree, Graph, Heap, etc.)
- âœ… Fundamental Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, etc.)
- âœ… Problem-solving Patterns (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Greedy, Backtracking, etc.)
- âœ… Practice Problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, GFG, and Codeforces
- âœ… Interview-focused questions with Java implementations
-
